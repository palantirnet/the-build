  # currently only used when setting up the settings.php file for a Drupal site.

# Drupal configuration used by targets/drupal.xml
drupal:
  # Relative path to the Drupal web root. This is co-dependent with the composer installer
  # configuration in your `composer.json`. Use caution when changing this value.

  sites:
    # Configuration values for a Drupal site build. The values in this section
    # must be customized for each Drupal multisite installation that you add.
    #
    # This site configuration is partial; it will be completed in targets/the-build.xml by
    # loading any missing values from drupal.sites._defaults.
    #
    # To add a Drupal multisite installation, copy these default values into
    # your project's .the-build/build.yml file and change
    # the 'default' key to the name of your new multisite. The key must not
    # contain '.' characters, but the 'dir' property may.
    default:
      # REQUIRED: Name of the sites subdirectory where the `settings.php` file
      # should live.
      dir: default

      # REQUIRED: Your site's URI; the default should be the URI of your local
      # development environment.
      uri: "https://${projectname}.local"

      # Customizing the following values is OPTIONAL. If these values are not
      # explicitly configured, they will be set in the-build.xml based on the
      # 'dir' value configured above.
      #
      # NOTE: Properties may use other properties in their values, which are
      # expanded when the property file is loaded. We can not use that behavior
      # here because these values must reference a variable path: the 'default'
      # key in the 'drupal.sites.*' properties.

#
# Also consider:
#   * Tagging tests based on where they should run (e.g. '@skipci')

# composer:
#   composer: /path/to/composer.phar

#
# Use these properties if you're using a Composer + Yarn install process for your
